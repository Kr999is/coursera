        The Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) is a powerful and intuitive security tool. BeEF is pioneering
        techniques
        that provide penetration testers with practical client-side attack vectors. Unlike other security frameworks,
        BeEF
        focuses on leveraging browser vulnerabilities to assess the security posture of a target. This project is
        developed
        solely for lawful research and penetration testing.

        BeEF hooks one or more web browsers to the application for the launching of directed command modules. Each
        browser is
        likely to be within a different security context, and each context may provide a set of unique attack vectors.
        The
        framework allows the penetration tester to select specific modules (in real-time) to target each browser, and
        therefore each context.

        The framework cosntains numerous command modules that employ BeEF's simple and powerful API. This API is at the
        heart
        of the framework's effectiveness and efficiency. It abstracts complexity and facilitates quick development of
        custom
        modules.

        The clip took an unexpected turn, however, when the chicken suddenly disappeared, but the player continued to
        experience the same jump boost that the animal provided before. At first the player wasnt fully aware of the
        strange occurrence, but quickly realized what was going on.

        “I think the chicken just glitched,” they explained to their teammate, and continued “Yeah, theres no chicken
        but
        I [still] have the chicken [jump] ability.” The player showed off just how broken the glitch could be as they
        quickly climbed the Spire, and totally outpaced the games regular movement.
